        <h1>Ben Couser</h1>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Ben, an automation specialist with a focus on machine learning, from Wales, UK. 
            I've always had a passion for the interconnected worlds of science and technology. 
            With a master's degree in physics and a thesis on type 2B string theory, 
            I've ventured into the realm of machine learning and always strive for continual expansion of my knowledge.</p>
        <p>This website you're exploring right now has been created almost entirely with the assistance of ChatGPT, so don't judge my coding skilling from this. 
            I've employed this AI to help generate structure with HTML, style with CSS, and add functionality using Javascript. 
            I believe this is a great demonstration of how AI can make people more productive and impactful through collaboration.</p>
        <p>Here on my website, you'll find articles and blog posts that delve into my varied interestsâ€”ranging from machine learning to the books that I am interested in. 
            The purpose is twofold: I aim to not only share knowledge and insights but also to develop my skills in language and communication.</p>
        <p>So, whether you're interested in TensorFlow tutorials, physics discussions, or a dive into my thinking, you've come to the right place!</p>
