# MyWebsite

## Introduction :wave:

Hello there! Welcome to the repository for my personal website and blog. This project serves as an experiment to gauge my productivity when utilising ChatGPT and enhance my linguistic skills. Go take a look [here!](www.bencouser.co.uk)

## Objectives :dart:

- **Productivity Experiment**: By setting up this website, I aim to measure how efficiently I can manage and deliver content using ChatGPT as an aid. Note that I have relatively no web development experience.
- **Linguistic Improvement**: The article section of the website will feature articles written by me. This will serve as a platform to hone my writing skills and effectively communicate complex ideas.

## Technologies Used :computer:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/research/chatgpt) for website generation and trouble shooting
