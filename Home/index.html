        <h1>Ben Couser</h1>
        <p>Hello there! I'm Ben, an automation specialist with a focus on machine learning, from Wales, UK. 
            I've always had a passion for the interconnected worlds of science and technology. 
            With a master's degree in physics and a thesis on type 2B string theory, 
            I've ventured into the realm of machine learning and always strive for continual expansion of my knowledge.</p>
        <p>This website you're exploring right now has been created almost entirely with the assistance of ChatGPT, so don't judge my coding skilling from this.
            I've employed this AI to help generate structure with HTML, style with CSS, and add functionality using Javascript. 
            I believe this is a great demonstration of how AI can make people more productive and impactful through collaboration.</p>
        <p>Here on my website, you'll find articles and blog posts that delve into my varied interestsâ€”ranging from machine learning to the books that I am interested in. 
            The purpose is twofold: I aim to not only share knowledge and insights but also to develop my skills in language and communication.</p>
        <p>So, whether you're interested in TensorFlow tutorials, physics discussions, or a dive into my thinking, you've come to the right place!</p>

            <h3>Masters Degree in Physics from Swansea University: Specializing in Type 2B String Theory</h3>
            <p>During my four-years at Swansea University, I engaged in two substantial research projects. 
                In my third year, I focused on simulating quantum harmonic and anharmonic oscillators. 
                For this, I utilized Monte Carlo methods and various statistical techniques, coding the simulations in Python.</p>
            <p>My final-year project was in the realm of string theory.
                Specifically, I modeled the inter-quark potential through the AdS/CFT correspondence. 
                I used the Mathematica language to numerically solve complex equations that couldn't be tackled analytically. 
                Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of this research was self-directed and conducted from home.
                Through my research I was able to model the inter-quark potential at both short and far distances.
                Note: See sidebar "Masters Dissertation" for more!</p>
            <p>In addition to these projects, I participated in a residential trip to Gregynog. 
                There, I learned the intricacies of pitching research proposals to secure funding. 
                These diverse experiences honed my ability to multitask, work independently, and communicate complex ideas effectively. 
                I had the opportunity to present my original findings to large audiences, adeptly fielding technical questions on the spot.</p>

            <p>At Swansea University, my educational journey was not just confined to theoretical understanding but 
                extended to practical skill-building that has equipped me for a multidisciplinary career. 
                My foray into Python programming was more than just a cursory encounter; 
                it was an intensive application during research projects where I employed Monte Carlo methods and statistical techniques to simulate complex quantum systems. 
                This offered me a deep dive into statistical mathematics, enriching my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. 
                My coursework in Computational Physics, Quantum Field Theory, Particle Physics, 
                and Statistical Mechanics provided me with a fundamental understanding of the diverse and interconnected domains within the field of physics. 
                The final-year project in string theory was particularly instrumental in honing my research capabilities 
                and familiarity with computational tools like Mathematica. 
                These multifaceted experiences have not only made me adept at managing multiple tasks but have also instilled 
                in me the confidence to work independently and present my findings to professional audiences.</p>

        <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
        <p>The COVID-19 lockdowns presented a unique opportunity for personal growth, and I seized it to invest in both my mental and physical well-being. 
            I took up running and weight lifting as more than just a hobby; they became part of my daily routine. 
            The discipline and endurance required for these activities offered lessons that extended far beyond the gym and the running track. 
            It was also a time for intellectual growth; I delved into a range of reading materials, 
            absorbing knowledge and perspectives that spanned from science, philosphy and fiction.</p>
        <p>After a period of introspection and self-improvement, I was eager to take on a new challenge. 
            In June 2023, after our pool team concluded its season, I decided to diversify my physical activities by enrolling in kickboxing classes. 
            This new venture is not just a test of my physical capabilities but also a measure of my mental toughness. 
            It has been an exhilarating experience, pushing my limits and developing my focus, discipline, and resilience.
