    "title": "Love and Math, The Heart of Hidden Reality",
    "author": "Edward Frenkel",
    "summary": "To most, love and mathematics seem to be wildly different topics. Maths, as Edward states himself, is remembered by most as the topic they were forced to take in school and never to be touched again. Love and Math attempts to distill down complex topics, such as String Theory and Langlands Program, whilst also showing his immense passion for the field, it’s utterly contagious. Some sections get heavy but the readers guide helps us understand that although the topics may be difficult to grasp, the overall concept will still ring true without a deep understanding."

    "author": "Isaac Asimov",
    "summary": "A collection of short stories, told from the memory of Susan Calvin, a Robopsycologist. The tales follow in chronological order, ranging from the first robots created commercially to the AI’s eventual surpassing of human intelligence. Although completely unrelated to the popular movie of the same name (excluding the fundamental 3 laws of robotics), this is a worthwhile read for anyone in the AI space or interested in SciFi."
